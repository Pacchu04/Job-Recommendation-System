# Job-Recommendation-System
Build a job recommendation engine using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques. Continuously refine the recommendation algorithm based on user feedback and engagement data.

Content-based filtering leverages the textual content of job descriptions to compute similarities between jobs using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The recommendations can be enhanced by incorporating user feedback, making them more personalized and relevant. This method ensures that job recommendations are tailored to the user's interests and previous interactions with the system.
